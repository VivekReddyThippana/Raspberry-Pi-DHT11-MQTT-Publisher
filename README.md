# Raspberry-Pi-DHT11-MQTT-Publisher
A Python-based IoT project that reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi and publishes it to an MQTT broker (e.g., HiveMQ). The data is formatted in JSON and sent at regular intervals, enabling remote monitoring via any MQTT client or home automation system.
